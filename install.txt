Required software:
  - git
  - cmake
  - gcc, g++ and MPI compiler wrappers (e.g. openmpi, mpich)

Installation:
- Choose a "flavor" that suites your environment and installation preferences:
  - The convention for a flavor name is "target_platform-libraries_type":
    - osx-static or osx-shared (for Mac OSX)
    - cee-static or toss3-static (for Linux; the differences are minor)
    (still working on shared libraries flavors for Linux)

- Run the following commands in the root directory for your flavor
  (cee-static in this example) to build and install Calibr8 and all
  of its dependencies using 4 processors
    > source capp-setup.sh
    > source env/cee-static.sh
    > capp load
    > capp build -f cee-static -j 4
